\section{Introduction}
The contributions of this paper can be summarised as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introducing a novel method to infer state models from black-box systems
    \item Proposing a convolutional-recurrent hybrid neural network architecture to extract the hidden internal states just by examining the input-output values of the system. This deep learning model can automatically perform feature extraction making it way more effective and flexible compared to traditional methods. In addition to that we do not make any assumption about statistical properties of the data which makes it applicable to a wider range of problems.
    \item Comparing our proposed method with existing state of the art and state of practice approaches using real world data from a large scale AutoPilot system developed by our industry partner.
    The results show ........ .
    \item Proposing a way to combine change point detection algorithms and EFSM model inference algorithms to infer state models 
\end{itemize}
